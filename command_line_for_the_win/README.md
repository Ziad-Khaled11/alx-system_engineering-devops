# SFTP 
In this task we used SFTP to transfer files from local device to online sandbox
## First
we copy SFTP from sandbox page and paste it in the command prompt then 
enter password which we can find in the sandbox page
here we are connected to the snadbox and the local device at the same time
### SFTP Notes
write ? to get all the commands in SFTP prompet
in summary
use l before each command to access local device 
and remotley use normal commands
## Second
we copy SSH from sandbox page and paste it in the powershell then
enter the same password we entered before the you have a full
access to the sandbox as in the webpage
and here you can use the normal linux and git commands
## Finally
any change you do in SFTP will directly appear in SSH and vice versa
but to appear on github you must push files using SSh
